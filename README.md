# Hanna
Woowahan Brothers Inc. is a leading food-tech company in Korea. It provides food delivery application, named ‘Baedal Minjok’, which is known for no commission fee. Also, it has service that focused more on delivering with famous restaurants named ‘Baemin Riders’, and number one mobile grocery store named ‘Baemin Chan’. 
 These fonts, which are provided for everybody including designers to restaurant owners has named after employee’s kid’s real names. (Kim Hanna, KimJua…)
 Badal Minjok’s fonts used Korea’s 1960’s and 1970’s signs as motif. These fonts were impressed by the words written on Jeju’s taffy handcart, faded toilet sign in park of Homigot, Pohang, etc.
 Baedal Minjok wants to exclude beauty of grace, and be free of specific trend or designer’s influence. Instead, we respect unprofessional, but lovely glance of normal people.

Hanna represents kitsch and retro style of Baedal Minjok, which has motif of 1960’s and 70’s signs. Sheets were put on the acrylic panel and cut off with knife to make the signs. This font resembles such uneven, crooked feature.
